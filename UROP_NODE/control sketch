This is pseudocode given by Rodrigo to sketch out how we will first approach the sat control

while(True): #main control loop

	alarms() #check if system is in working conditions, handle errors ex. device drawing too much power
	updateTelemetry() #update data
	if(commEnabled): #is the sat in communication mode with devices

	setValues(dataFromBus) #set values according to data received, return to while loop at end

"""
Genral Notes:
	
	Need to figure out how to communicate with PL Bus as slave, how to handle interrupts. Check if there is a FIFO at bus to act as buffer if data is received during control
	loop or if an immediate interrupt is required to handle incoming data without loss.
