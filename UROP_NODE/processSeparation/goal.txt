The final framework will be structured as 4 separate processes. 

- One process will be in charge of camera tracking and FSM control. 
- Another process will take care of SER optimization. 
- The third process will be the main control loop, which will be very similar to the one already in place. 
- The fourth process will handle changing the USB switches so that the RPI will be configured as either a slave for normal operation or as a host for software updates. 

There will be interprocess communication between the four using threading and semaphores to allow for concurrency to ensure for correct process scheduling during system calls to meet any latency constraints.
