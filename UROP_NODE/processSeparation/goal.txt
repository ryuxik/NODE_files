The final framework will be structured as 2 separate processes. 

- One process will be in charge of camera tracking and FSM control. 
- Another process will take care of SER optimization, the main control loop, and changing the USB switches so that the RPI will be configured as either a slave for normal operation or as a host for software updates.
